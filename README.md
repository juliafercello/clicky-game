React Clicky Game

# Project OVerview 

This is a react game where the user needs to click on each image only once.  After each click, the system checks to see if the image has already been clicked and if not, increases the score and shuffles the cards around.  If the image has been clicked already, the game resets. 

In addition to React, this game also uses Bootstrap.
