React Clicky Game

# Project OVerview 

This is a React app where users are able to test their memory. They need to click each image, but only once. The catch is that after each click, the images are shuffled around. 

Each time the user clicks an image, the system checks to see if it has already been clicked and if not, increases the score and shuffles the cards.  If the image has already been clicked, a message is displayed to the user informing them they lost and a new game is started. 

In addition to React, this game also uses Bootstrap.
